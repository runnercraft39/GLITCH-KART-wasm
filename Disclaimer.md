GLITCH-KART

I do not own Glitch, GLITCH KARTS, Glitch Productions or any of their counterparts.
I am simply uploading this for some people's view.
The game is not open source, so don't expect every file.
I am also new to GitHub, so don't expect a lot.
if GLITCH requests this to be taken down, such will happen.
Thanks!
